				Drawing on over three thousand letters from the Blairs Letters and Scots Missions collections of the Scottish
				Catholic Archives at the University of Aberdeen, the maps on this interactive site track the movement of letters
				and individuals connected to Scottish Catholicism between 1640 and 1699. Facing persecution for their faith in
				the British Isles, many Scots Catholics chose temporary or permanent exile in Catholic Europe where they could
				openly practice their faith. Many of the men featured in the SCA collections became ordained secular priests and
				returned to Scotland as missionaries, where they provided catechism to the countryâ€™s practicing Catholics and
				converted more. Their mission flowed from institutions in Europe that trained priests and equipped them with the
				resources necessary to embark on missionary work back to Scotland. The maps on this site show the mechanisms of
				the networks they created in the tumultuous period of the seventeenth century.
